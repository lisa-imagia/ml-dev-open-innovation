# Machine Learning Developer Challenge
## Context
The Open Innovation team has developed in collaboration with a public research laboratory a new model to classify images from handwritten digits. The model, delivered in tensorflow.keras, seems to have good performances but the team needs to conduct more tests to confirm the results.
Moreover, the code is not integrated in any part of Imagiaâ€™s pipeline.

The goal of this exercise is to bring this code a step closer to industrial production by enhancing and integrating it into a service.

## Starting Point
The model delivered by the research lab is a simple CNN with two convolutions. It was trained using the `tensorflow.keras` framework.

This repository contains:

* `main.py`, which is the source code delivered by the research lab
* `weights.h5`, which are the weights of the pretrained model

So far, two functionalities has been implemented:
```
python main.py --train
```

Will launch a training and overwrite weights.h5
```
python main.py --predict [path_to_image]
```

Will launch a prediction on a single image (for example `python --predict example/8.png` should output `Predicted: 8`).

## Requirements

This challenge contains two parts. First, Imagia wishes to use tfrecords data instead of `mnist.load_data()` (line 29). This requires that you build a small pipeline providing multiple steps:
* Optional: use `tfrecords`: 
   * Process the 'data/mnist.npz' raw data to convert them to a `.tfrecord` format 
   * Modify the `train()` function consequently
* The data postprocessing and transformation should come with unit tests
* Feel free to modify the code structure as much as needed

Second, you will have to integrate this modified code into a **very light** RESTful service which can handle the following requests:

| Request Method | Resource | Request Header | Request Body  | Response Body | Response Status Code |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| TBD | http://IP:port/train | TBD | TBD | `{accuracy: x}` | TBD |
| `POST` | http://IP:port/predict | TBD | binary data to predict on. Format of file: `png` | `{prediction: x}` | TBD |

We ask you to meet the following requirements:
* Python >= 3.x
* Documentation (technical and readme to launch the service)
* We should be able to run and test the implemented solution
* Build a docker image for easier deployment

Questions:
* Is there any functionality you think would add value to the service?
* How would you scale this service?
* How would you reduce inference time?
* What would happen if we post a dog picture? Do you see any way to handle this situation?
